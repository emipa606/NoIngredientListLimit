# NoIngredientListLimit

Made this for those (slightly insane) users that has added so many mods that the ingredient-list is not able to show all items in the list.
The vanilla list when selecting ingredients for recipes cuts off around 400 items. 
This mod simply increased that x10, but if anyone should have more than 4000 ingredients added I can of course increase it some more.

Inspired when overhearing HydromancerX, also where I got the preview-image list.
